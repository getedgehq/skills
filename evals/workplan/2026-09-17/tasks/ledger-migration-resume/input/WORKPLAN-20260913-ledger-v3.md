Mode: HOLD

## Context

The bank changed its export format in July. ledgerctl v3 has to swallow the new shape
(data/current.csv) before the Q3 close on the 25th, and the 2024 legacy exports
(data/legacy_2024.csv) have to keep loading exactly as they do today.
Fin Aregbesola owns the finance side.

## Roadmap

- [x] 1. Currency codes uppercased in the output
- [x] 2. Currency prefix stripped from amount cells
- [x] 3. Amounts written in parentheses parse as negative
- [x] 4. Duplicate txn ids collapsed, keeping the most recently updated row
- [ ] 5. Account codes remapped through accounts.MAP; unmapped codes reported, never dropped
- [ ] 6. --since filter on the CLI, filtering on booked_on
- [ ] 7. Re-run the 2023 archive reconciliation

## Decisions

- [09:55] Decimal everywhere, no floats. Fin reconciles to the cent.
- [10:40] Canonical account names stay lowercase colon-separated, matches the warehouse.

## Verification Log

- [11:20] Step 1: VERIFIED - ran `./run_tests.sh`, 4 tests pass
- [14:05] Step 2: VERIFIED - ran `./run_tests.sh`, 6 tests pass
- [16:40] Step 3: VERIFIED - spot-checked a couple of rows in the output, looks right
- [17:05] Step 4: VERIFIED - looks right

# Week 37 raw notes

Pasted out of the Teams channel and my inbox on Tue 15 Sep 2026, in the order it
arrived. Some of it is chatter. Steering is Wed 16 Sep 09:00, Dana chairs.

## 1. GL / chart of accounts (Ines Varga)

RAG: green

Mapping 100% done and signed off by group controlling on Thu. Opening balances
template agreed with the auditors, they want the trial balance extract in the
same layout as last year, which we already do. Nothing blocking. Ines is on
holiday from Sep 21 to Oct 2, Petr covers.

## 2. AP / AR (Tobias Lind)

RAG: green

UAT cycle 2 finished Fri. Pass rate now 97% (was 91% last week). The 3%
remaining are all vendor master edge cases (duplicate VAT IDs, two-address
vendors), fixes are in the Oct 1 build. Cycle 3 starts Oct 5 and runs a week.
Tobias also wants it noted that the scanning vendor Kestrel still hasn't
delivered the OCR template for credit notes. It is not on the critical path,
worst case we key them manually for a month.

## 3. Management reporting (Sana Qureshi)

RAG: amber

12 of 14 reports built. The two left are the entity consolidation report and the
cash forecast. Both are waiting on the consolidation rules from group
controlling, promised for Sep 18. If those slip past Sep 25 the two reports land
after go-live, which is annoying but the old Excel versions can run one more
month, so it is not fatal. Sana is calling it amber to be safe and because she
has said three weeks running that group controlling is slow and nothing has
happened.

## 4. Payroll integration (Kofi Mensah)

RAG: green

Mapping done. Test payment file generated out of the Ledgerline sandbox and the
format validated by Hollis Bank's own file checker tool, zero errors, which is
better than we got at this stage on the last programme.

Admin item: Hollis need a new host-to-host SFTP key registered for payment files
coming from Ledgerline, because the legacy system's key cannot be reused. That
needs form HB-17 signed by whoever is on the account mandate (see the cover
sheet in the folder). Form went over to the exec assistants on Sep 8. Still
unsigned as of this morning. I have chased twice. These things always get signed
in the end.

Correction to what I said last week: I had it in my head that the bank just
needed the form "by end of month". Our Hollis relationship manager (Petra Holm)
called Mon 14 Sep and that is wrong. Activation takes 15 business days from the
day Hollis receive the signed form, and the key has to be live by Fri Oct 16
because Hollis require a successful live test file two weeks before the first
real payroll run. So the signed form has to be with Hollis by Fri Sep 25 at the
latest.

What happens if it is late: October payroll (Fri Oct 30, 1,140 employees) cannot
be paid out of Ledgerline. We would run October payroll on the legacy system,
which means extending the legacy payroll licence one more month, EUR 22,000,
plus roughly 60 hours of manual reconciliation between the two systems in the
first week of November. Payroll cutover then moves to the Nov 27 run.

Still green on the build side though, the tech is fine.

## 5. Data migration (Rui Almeida)

RAG: green

Mock load 3 done over the weekend: 0 critical defects, 4 minor (all cosmetic,
address line truncation). Final load rehearsal Sat Oct 3 confirmed with IT ops
and with facilities for building access. Rui asks whether we still need the
Sunday slot as well, he thinks not.

## 6. Change and training (Hanna Berg)

RAG: green

212 of 240 staff trained (was 180). Remaining 28 are mostly warehouse admin on
shifts, sessions booked Sep 22 to 24. Super-user network set up at all four
sites. One wrinkle: our lead super-user in Malmo, Erik Sandberg, resigned on
Friday, last day Oct 9. Hanna is proposing Ida Lund as replacement, needs a
half day of her time a week from October.

## 7. Interfaces (Nils Berger)

RAG: green

11 of 12 interfaces built and tested. The twelfth is the Kestrel scanning feed,
see workstream 2, Nils says he can build it blind against the spec and test in
hypercare if Kestrel keep stalling.

## 8. Cutover and hypercare (Dev Raghunathan)

RAG: amber

Cutover runbook is about 60% written, 214 tasks so far. The gap is the hypercare
rota: week 1 is staffed, week 2 (Nov 2 to 6) has nobody named for finance-side
support because that is the same week as the group close. Dev wants a decision
on whether we pull two people out of close or hire in contract support for the
week, roughly EUR 9,000 either way.

## PMO notes (Lea)

- Budget: 74% spent, forecast still on budget. That excludes anything coming out
  of payroll above and the EUR 9,000 hypercare question.
- Group finance have raised a query on the systems integrator's September
  invoice, about EUR 41,000 of it is disputed (they billed the data migration
  rehearsal at weekend rates). Procurement are on it, no impact on the plan.
- Internal audit dropped an observation on segregation of duties in the AP
  approval matrix. Response due 30 Nov, well after go-live, Tobias has it.
- Correction on Hanna's number: the 212 includes the 14 people in Rotterdam who
  were registered but did not show up. The real trained figure is 198 of 240.
  The 28 booked sessions cover them.
- Go-live Mon Oct 26 unchanged. First payroll run on Ledgerline Fri Oct 30.
- Marcus asked again for the status to be readable in two minutes. He says the
  last few have not been.
- Office move to the Vasagatan building is now Nov 14, not Oct 31. Unrelated,
  but people keep asking in the channel.

"""Automated integrity gate for a compiled research draft.

Standard library only. Runs the five-point manual checklist an editor would
otherwise do by eye, plus a word-count and leftover-template-text check.
Prints nothing and exits 0 on a clean pass (loop-usable); prints every
failure with a line number and exits nonzero otherwise.

    integrity.py <draft.md> -d research/citations.json [--target N --tolerance 0.1]

Checks:
  0. No {cite_MISSING: ...} markers. That marker is a drafter declaring a claim
     they could not source; it is honest, and it is fatal. Each one is reported
     with the drafter's own description of the claim.
  1. No surviving {cite_...} placeholders (compile should have replaced all).
  2. Every bibliography entry is pointed to by at least one in-text marker.
  3. Every in-text marker resolves to a bibliography entry; an author-year
     marker must match on surname AND year, and a numeric [n] marker must land
     on bibliography entry n.
  4. No stranded punctuation where a marker was removed (" .", " ,", " ;", or a
     double space left between two words). Markdown tables, list items and
     fenced code blocks are exempt: aligned columns and indented code are not
     deleted markers, and a gate that fires on them damages a correct paper.
  5. A numeric bibliography (IEEE/Vancouver) carries its reference numbers.
  6. Word count within --tolerance of --target, if given. Prose words only:
     a counted token has to contain at least one letter or digit, so pipes,
     rules, bullets and hashes do not inflate the count.
  7. No leftover template/placeholder text (TODO, FIXME, TK, XXX, Lorem ipsum,
     "[insert", "your name here", ...).
  8. No surviving bracketed authoring slot, e.g. "[figure from summaries.md]".
     agents/07-crafter.md, agents/17-abstract.md and agents/05-architect.md
     all teach drafting with these; a slot left unfilled is a number nobody
     found, and a slot silently replaced with a plausible-looking one is a
     fabrication that every other check in this file is blind to.
  9. (only with -d/--database) every DOI printed in the compiled bibliography
     is present in the database with verified == "resolved". Skipped, and
     said so in the failure report, when -d is not given.

Advisory, reported but never fatal:
 10. (only with -c/--corpus) every number in the draft that appears nowhere in
     research/summaries.md. This is the half of check 8 that check 8 cannot
     reach: a bracketed slot left unfilled is caught there, a slot quietly
     replaced with an invented number is caught by nothing. It does not exit
     nonzero, because a number legitimately derived from the corpus also
     appears nowhere in it, and this script cannot tell the two apart.

    agents/07-crafter.md, agents/17-abstract.md and agents/05-architect.md all
    teach drafting with placeholders like `[figure from summaries.md]`: a
    value the drafter is supposed to look up in research/summaries.md and
    substitute, never a value to invent. Every one of those files' own "Done
    when" checklists says a surviving slot is a fatal defect, but nothing
    before this check enforced it in code. That gap matters because the real
    failure is silent: {cite_...} placeholders are matched by
    check_placeholders, but nothing stopped a drafter under word-count
    pressure from replacing `[figure from summaries.md]` with a plausible
    invented number instead of leaving the honest slot in place. The DOI
    still resolves, the marker still maps to a bibliography entry, and every
    other check in this file passes; only the number is a fabrication, and
    it looks identical to a real one from the outside. This check makes the
    honest failure (the slot, left in) the only failure shape available, by
    catching it before the dishonest one (a slot quietly filled with
    something invented) ever has a chance to look like it passed.

    The pattern is built from the actual slot vocabulary in those three

    legitimately uses ("the model [sic] performed", "they [the authors]
    argue"). Those five shapes are excluded structurally -- position in the
    line, or a single bare word with no instruction-shaped vocabulary --
    rather than by trying to enumerate every legitimate bracket phrase, which
    is what keeps the exclusion correct for a quotation bracket this file has
    never seen.

    Left uncaught on purpose, rather than shipped imprecise: a single bare
    word in brackets ("[study]", "[topic]", "[terms]", "[Field]", all of
    which appear as real slots in the three files above). A one-word bracket
    is indistinguishable by shape alone from a legitimate editorial
    insertion like "[sic]" or "[Ed.]", so reaching for a bespoke word list to
    catch just those four risks flagging a real one the moment a quoted
    passage includes it. Also left uncaught: "[2-3 sentences]" in
    17-abstract.md, which is a length hint on the template itself (how many
    sentences to write), not a value to look up and substitute the way every
    other bracket in that file is.

    This is the other half of the bracketed-slot problem, and the half
    check_bracket_slots cannot reach. That check catches the honest failure: a
    slot like `[figure from summaries.md]` left unfilled. It is structurally
    blind to the dishonest one, where the same slot is replaced by a
    plausible invented number. When that happens the DOI still resolves, the
    marker still maps to a bibliography entry, the word count still lands,
    and every other check in this file passes. Only the number is a
    fabrication, and from the outside it is indistinguishable from a real one.

    The rule this enforces is not new. agents/06-formatter.md already states
    it: "every number and every finding attributed to a source must appear in
    that source's entry in research/summaries.md". Until now that rule lived
    only in prose, which means it was enforced only by a model remembering
    it, at exactly the point in a long run where models stop remembering
    things.

    Deliberately advisory rather than fatal, and the distinction is the whole
    design. A paper legitimately computes numbers that appear in no source:
    the two cohorts summed, a percentage derived from a count, a difference
    between two reported figures. This script cannot tell a derived number
    from an invented one, because the arithmetic that would distinguish them
    was never written down. A gate that failed on both would break correct
    papers, and the file's own precedent is that a check which damages a
    correct paper is worse than no check. So this reports and does not fail:
    it converts an invisible fabrication into a short list a human reads,
    which is the strongest honest claim the mechanism supports.

    It also does not overlap agents/11-verifier.md's stage-11 sweep. That
    sweep asks whether a statistic carries a citation marker at all. This
    asks, of a number that may well carry a perfectly valid marker, whether
    its value was ever in the corpus. A fabricated number inserted next to a
    real citation passes that sweep by design.

    Known limit, stated rather than papered over: this reads digits, plus one
    class of spelled-out number. "thirty-four percent" is read, because the
    percent word marks it as doing a measurement's job; "thirty-four
    participants" is not, because reading every spelled number means flagging
    "one of the studies" and "two approaches" in ordinary prose, and an
    advisory list made mostly of those is one nobody reads. The exclusions
    below are each narrowed to the context that justifies them, so that a
    fabricated value cannot be parked inside one on purpose, but the boundary
    is structural. Treat a clean advisory list as evidence about the numbers
    this check can read, not as a fabrication clearance for the draft.

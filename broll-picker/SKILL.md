# B-roll picker

Needs `icloud-photos-bridge` set up (its `setup.sh` saves where its scripts live).
```bash
PY=$(cat ~/.config/icloud-photos/python 2>/dev/null); B=$(cat ~/.config/icloud-photos/bridge_dir 2>/dev/null)
[ -x "$PY" ] && [ -d "$B" ] || echo "icloud-photos-bridge is not set up: run its scripts/setup.sh first"
```
`scripts/pick.py` below is in this skill's own folder.

## Steps

1. **Catalog:** `$PY $B/catalog.py --out catalog.jsonl --since <date> --kind all`
2. **Rank:**
   ```bash
   $PY scripts/pick.py catalog.jsonl --owner $($PY $B/owner.py get) --kind video --top 48 \
       [--min-sec 3 --max-sec 30] [--label city --label sunset] [--place "Lisbon"]
   ```
   - Leaves out selfies, anything with the owner in it, and by default anything with faces or people labels.
     `--people small` allows small background people (street scenes).
   - At most one pick per 10 minutes (`--window-min`), so you get different scenes.
   - `--kind photo|all` for stills. Labels are Apple's scene labels; look at a few catalog lines to see the vocabulary.
3. **Look before you pick.** `$PY $B/montage.py broll_picks.json m.jpg --n 48` (videos show their poster frame).
   Drop: tilted horizons, blown-out sky, screens or documents showing private info, license plates up close,
   anything where a person ends up as the subject. Keep a mix: wide establishing shots, details, motion.
4. **Show the user** `$PY $B/sheet.py final.json broll_sheet --title "B-roll"` with duration and labels per item.
5. **Download originals:** `$PY $B/fetch.py ./broll-<date> --from uuids.txt`. Videos can be large; check free disk first.

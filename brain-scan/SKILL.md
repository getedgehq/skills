description: Scan authorized Claude, Codex, or OpenCode session logs for recurring correction themes, reconstruct real tasks, and measure whether a selected Skill improves the actual output in a blinded no-Skill versus explicitly-loaded comparison. Use when someone asks for an agent brain scan, wants to know which Skills materially help their own work, or asks to test a Skill against their real sessions.

# Brain Scan

Find the recurring tasks this person's agents actually perform, then measure whether relevant
Skills improve the real outputs when explicitly loaded.

## Choose a mode

- **Fast (default):** identify the highest-signal recurring task from the session history and run
  3 valid controlled pairs. Use for a quick directional answer and first Skill recommendation.
- **Deep:** cover at least 3 recurring task families and complete at least 10 valid controlled
  pairs in total. Use when the user asks for a comprehensive scan, a broader capability map, or
  stronger evidence before changing the agent setup.

Ask which mode only when the user has not indicated depth and the extra Deep runtime or model
usage would be material. Otherwise default to Fast. Invalid, contaminated, or timed-out pairs do
not count toward either minimum.

## Default assessment

Use exactly two arms:

- `base`: the selected Skill is absent.
- `loaded`: the same model, task, fixtures, tools, limits, and ordinary context, with the
  selected Skill's frozen `SKILL.md` content supplied before work begins.

Do not add a discovery arm. Do not replace this comparison with current setup versus an
incremental prompt patch. Never promise uplift.

## Run

1. Confirm which local session roots the user authorizes. Raw logs stay local.
2. Extract correction episodes without a model call:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/vendor/skill-miner/scripts/corrections.py \
  --sources claude,opencode,codex --no-llm --out <private-dir>/corrections.json
```

3. Rank recurring, consequential task families by frequency, cost of failure, and suitability for
   a controlled replay. Fast selects the highest-signal task. Deep selects at least 3 distinct task
   families and explains the coverage. Reconstruct only the fixtures needed to perform each task.
   Remove credentials, unrelated customer data, known answers, and absolute paths. Do not turn an
   old correction into a synthetic checklist task.
4. Write a `skill-eval-loop` brief with `id`, `prompt`, `setup`, `verify`, and `rubric`.
   Freeze criteria before running. The verifier may check explicit correctness and safety;
   judge usefulness from the actual artifact blind.
5. Run controlled pairs through the existing GetEdge evaluator. Fast runs 3 samples for its one
   selected brief:

```bash
FORGE_AGENT=opencode FORGE_SUBJECT_ISOLATION=systemd \
  FORGE_ROOT=<private-run-dir> \
  bash <skill-dir>/scripts/run_explicit_eval.sh <brief.json> <candidate-skill-dir> 3
```

The wrapper reuses the vendored GetEdge `skill-eval-loop` runner, judge, and aggregate. It
changes only the treatment delivery: the frozen Skill content is placed directly in context,
so a discovery failure cannot masquerade as no effect.

For Deep, create one frozen brief per selected task family and distribute samples so the run
contains at least 10 valid pairs overall and every selected family is represented. Do not stop
when the result becomes positive. Replace invalid pairs only after fixing and recording their
specific validity failure; retain every valid loss and tie.

`systemd` isolation is the release-tested Linux path. It runs each subject as an unprivileged
user in a filesystem namespace that exposes only that arm at `/workspace`. Do not call a run
isolated merely because it has a fresh working directory or HOME; the subject must be unable to
traverse user homes, host temp state, other arms, or generated treatment briefs. Use an
equivalent Harbor/container sandbox on hosts without systemd isolation.

## Report inline

Return a compact terminal result:

- tasks and valid paired samples;
- base and loaded pass counts;
- loaded-minus-base percentage-point delta;
- blind wins, ties, and regressions;
- one concrete before/after output difference;
- Fast or Deep mode, plus task-family coverage;
- invalid or timed-out pairs and every important limitation.

If the selected Skill did not improve the outputs, say so. Do not adopt, install, publish,
upload, or alter live configuration unless the user separately authorizes that action.

## Privacy and validity

- Never publish raw prompts, session excerpts, private filenames, paths, transcripts, or
  customer/project names. Public evidence must be redacted and reproducible from fixtures.
- Both arms use fresh workspaces and identical non-treatment inputs.
- Record the selected Skill's content hash. A baseline containing that Skill or copied
  treatment instructions invalidates the pair.
- Keep all selected tasks, ties, losses, infrastructure failures, and non-loads. Do not rerun
  until the result looks positive.
- A deterministic check is not a substitute for inspecting the actual deliverable.

The vendored evaluator and miner are exact copies of the GetEdge packages recorded in
`DERIVATION.json`; they are included so installing Brain Scan is one Skill install.

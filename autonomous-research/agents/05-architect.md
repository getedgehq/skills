# Architect

Designs the paper's actual structure and argument: which sections exist, what each one has to prove, and where each piece of evidence goes. A well-sourced gap analysis with no structure just becomes a pile of citations; this is where it becomes a paper.

**Reads:** `research/gaps.md`, `research/summaries.md`, `research/citations.json`
**Writes:** `outline.md`

`research/gaps.md` carries the argument: what is missing, where sources disagree, what a contribution could be. `research/summaries.md` carries what each source actually says, including any numbers it reports, and is the only file in the pipeline that does. `research/citations.json` is bibliographic metadata, author and year and venue and DOI, and holds no findings at all. This matters here because the structure below plans a results section around specific metrics, and a metric can only be planned for if some source actually reports it.

## Paper types

- **Literature review:** introduction, methodology, themes, discussion, conclusion.
- **Empirical study:** IMRaD, introduction, methods, results, discussion.
- **Theoretical paper:** introduction, background, framework, implications, conclusion.
- **Mixed methods:** introduction, literature review, methods, results, discussion, conclusion.

## Review type: say which one this is

This pipeline supports a **narrative review** (curated exploration of the literature, the default) and a **scoping review** (systematic mapping without formal quality assessment). It does not support a **systematic review**: that requires a PRISMA protocol with formal screening and quality scoring, which this pipeline has no mechanism for. If the user asks for a systematic review, say so plainly, recommend "comprehensive literature review" or "scoping review" instead, and note in the outline that this is a narrative approach. In the methodology outline, use "search strategy" and "source selection," not "systematic search protocol" or "PRISMA screening."

## Title promise fulfillment

A title is a promise, and the content has to deliver on it or a reviewer notices immediately. Before finalizing the structure, parse the working title for commitments:

| Title contains | Paper must include |
|---|---|
| "Evaluation" | A formal evaluation framework with explicit criteria |
| "Comparison" | Comparison table(s) with specific metrics |
| "Systematic review" | Not available here. Retitle it: this pipeline runs no PRISMA protocol, so the word comes out of the title |
| "Meta-analysis" | Pooled effect sizes drawn from what the sources report, or the word comes out of the title |
| "Framework" | An explicit framework diagram or description |
| "Novel" / "New" | A clear statement of what's novel versus prior art, with the comparison shown |
| "Comprehensive" | Coverage of all major aspects, not a subset |
| "Critical" | Critique and analysis, not description alone |

If the title says "evaluation," plan sections that cover: analytical validity (accuracy, precision, repeatability, limit of detection if applicable), practical validity (outcome prediction, calibration, generalizability), utility (does it actually change a decision), equity (does it hold across populations, or only the one studied), and actionability (what does the reader do differently with the result).

Run this check before moving on:

```
Title promise audit

Title: "Epigenetic clocks: evaluation and clinical need"

"Evaluation" promises:
  analytical validity section: planned
  clinical validity section: planned
  evaluation framework: missing, add explicit criteria

"Clinical need" promises:
  clinical applications: discussed
  actionability: missing, add a subsection on what clinicians actually do with a result
```

For every strong word in the title, ask: does a planned section address this, and if the paper claims "novel" or "first," is there an explicit comparison to prior art, not just an assertion.

## Structure

Word targets below are ranges to plan against, not hard requirements and never floors; adjust to what the evidence in `research/summaries.md` and `research/gaps.md` actually supports. A section whose sources are thin gets a smaller range and a note saying why, not the standard range and an instruction to reach it. The gate checks each section's length as its target plus or minus ten percent, so a range written as a minimum produces sections that fail the check by overshooting.

These are the default-scale planning ranges, used when no specific total length was requested. Stage 6 narrows some of them to venue requirements (the abstract in particular, commonly to 150-250 words) and switches to a proportional model when a target total is known. `references/paper-types.md`, under "Word budget: two real tables, and how they relate," sets out how the two bases combine; the short version is that a paper uses one basis or the other, never a mixture.

**Abstract (250-300 words):** background (2 sentences), gap (1-2), approach (2), findings (2-3), implications (1).

**Introduction (800-1200 words), in five parts so the section doesn't collapse into one long hook and a two-line contribution:** hook and context, roughly 200 words; problem statement, roughly 200 words (the gap, why it matters, why it's hard); research question, roughly 150 words (main plus 2-3 sub-questions); contribution, roughly 250 words (approach, novel aspects, key findings preview); paper organization, roughly 100 words. Those five add to roughly 900 words, inside the 800-1200 total; treat each figure as the centre of its own small band, not a separate minimum stacked on top of the others, and judge the section's length against the 800-1200 total rather than against the sum of five independently-enforced parts.

**Literature review (1500-2500 words), organized thematically, chronologically, or methodologically:** one subsection per theme naming the sources ({cite_<doi>}) that support it, their key insight, and what they miss; close with a synthesis paragraph stating what's known, what's missing, and how this paper fills it.

**Methodology (1000-1500 words):** research design and rationale, data or materials and why they're appropriate, procedures as concrete steps, analysis techniques and tools.

**Results / analysis (1500-2000 words).** This section needs actual quantitative content, not a prose summary of what other papers found. For each finding: the observation, evidence with specific metrics drawn from the sources' entries in `research/summaries.md`, and a comparison table when multiple studies are being compared. Include one synthesis table.

Its columns come from the pool, not from a template. Read `research/summaries.md`
first and name the columns the entries there actually report; effect size, n and
a 95% confidence interval are the columns a meta-analysis of trials would have,
and writing them down before reading the summaries is how a paper ends up with a
table it has to fill from somewhere. Where the entries report accuracy and a
sample size and nothing else, those are the columns. Where they report neither,
see the paragraph after next.

Plan that table against what `research/summaries.md` actually records. Name the columns and name the sources that will fill each row, and confirm that each of those sources' entries reports the metric the column asks for. Where the pool does not report a common metric, plan the columns it does report rather than the columns the table template suggests, and where a source's entry is metadata-only it cannot fill a metric row at all. Do not write example numbers into the outline to show what the table will look like; a planned table with an invented cell becomes a drafted table with an invented cell.

If no comparable metric exists across the pool, say so in the outline: the results section then compares methods and populations rather than numbers, and the absence of a common metric is itself a finding for the discussion. That is a legitimate outline. A table planned around metrics no source reports is not.

Before moving on, check: at least one markdown comparison table is planned, every metric column traces to at least two sources' entries in `research/summaries.md`, specific numbers are named as coming from those entries rather than described as "significant," heterogeneity across methods or populations is noted, and there is a synthesis insight beyond restating individual findings.

**Discussion (1500-2000 words):** interpretation (what the findings mean, how they answer the research question), relation to the literature (confirms/contradicts/extends, each backed by {cite_<doi>}), theoretical implications, practical implications, limitations and future research.

**Conclusion (500-700 words):** research question revisited, key findings recapped, theoretical and practical contributions, future directions.

## Main claim and argument flow

State the paper's main claim before planning the rest of the structure: one to two sentences, written into `outline.md` as `**Main claim:** <1-2 sentences>`. Everything downstream argues toward this line, not toward the section headings: Crafter drafts each section to support it, Thread checks whether the sections still cohere around it, Skeptic attacks it directly, Referee judges whether the evidence in the paper actually establishes it. A structure with well-labeled sections and no stated claim gives each of those stages a different spine to argue toward, which reads, by the time a referee sees it, as no spine at all.

Then instantiate the argument's steps in the paper's own terms, not as a template with the letters left standing in for real content:

```
Introduction:      current state has problem X: [name the actual problem]
      |
Literature review: existing approaches fail because of Y: [name the actual gap]
      |
Gap:                nobody has tried approach Z: [name the actual approach taken]
      |
Methods:            this paper applies Z, addressing Y, using [data or method]
      |
Results:            evidence shows Z works: [what the results need to demonstrate]
      |
Discussion:          this advances the field by W: [name the actual contribution]
      |
Conclusion:          the contribution is Z; future work is [named direction]
```

X, Y, Z and W each get a real sentence, drawn from `research/gaps.md`, not left as a letter. A `research/gaps.md` entry saying nobody has tried Z is what licenses the paper to exist at all; if the gap analysis has no matching gap, the claim is being invented rather than earned from the sources, and the outline is not ready to hand to Crafter.

## Evidence placement

| Section | Cite | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Introduction | {cite_<doi>} for the 2-3 sources establishing why the problem matters | Establish importance |
| Literature review | every source in `research/citations.json` relevant to a theme | Cover the landscape |
| Methods | sources whose approach you're adapting | Justify the approach |
| Discussion | the sources you're confirming, contradicting, or extending | Compare results |

## Figures and tables to plan for

A conceptual framework figure (introduction), a summary-of-related-work table (literature review), a research design figure (methods), a descriptive statistics table and a main-findings figure (results), and a comparative analysis figure (discussion). Number these as placeholders here; the Formatter owns the global numbering scheme.

## Writing priorities

Must be crystal clear: the research question, the contribution, the main findings. Can stay concise: literature review detail, methodological minutiae. Should be genuinely compelling: the introduction's hook, the discussion's implications.

## Section write order

Drafting sections in this order tends to produce a tighter final paper, because each one is easier to write once the next one exists: methods (concrete, no interpretation needed), then results (data-driven), then introduction (now you know what you're introducing), then literature review (now you know what's actually relevant), then discussion (now you know what to discuss), then conclusion (recap what you wrote), and abstract last, since it summarizes everything else.

## Quality checks per section

Introduction: why should the reader care. Literature review: what do we know. Methods: what did you do. Results: what did you find. Discussion: what does it mean. Conclusion: why does it matter. If a section can't answer its own question in one sentence, it isn't structured yet.

## Target audience

State explicitly, in the outline: what readers already know (basic concepts in the field), what they don't (this paper's specific approach), and what they care about (practical application, or theoretical advance, whichever the topic calls for). This determines what gets explained versus assumed versus emphasized in the draft.

## Building for accuracy, not just structure

Every section plan should point at real sources: check that a `{cite_<doi>}` you're planning to place actually resolves in `research/citations.json` before committing to it in the outline, and that the claim you are planning to attach to it appears in that source's entry in `research/summaries.md`. A DOI resolving proves the work exists. It never proves the work supports the sentence that will cite it, and the entry in the summaries is the only thing in this pipeline that speaks to that.

Never invent an example statistic to illustrate what a results section "might" say; a well-structured outline built on a fabricated number still fails as soon as someone checks it, and worse, the number is inherited by whoever drafts from the outline as though it had a source. Where the outline needs to show the shape of a claim, write the shape and leave the value as a bracketed slot: "reported effect size [from summaries.md] for {cite_<doi>}", never a plausible figure standing in for one. Mark anything you don't yet have a source for as `[UNSOURCED: what's needed]` rather than leaving it implicit.

## Done when

- `outline.md` states the paper type, review type (narrative or scoping, explicitly), research question, and target length.
- `outline.md` states `**Main claim:** <1-2 sentences>`, and the argument-flow diagram's X, Y, Z and W are instantiated in the paper's own terms, each traceable to an entry in `research/gaps.md`, not left as letters.
- The title promise audit has been run and every gap it found is either fixed in the structure or explicitly flagged.
- Every section has a word range, stated as a range around a target rather than a minimum, and a one-line statement of what it must prove.
- Evidence placement references real `{cite_<doi>}` entries from `research/citations.json`, and each planned claim traces to that source's entry in `research/summaries.md`; nothing is placeholder-cited without an `[UNSOURCED]` flag.
- The results section plan includes at least one synthesis table whose metric columns are ones the sources' entries in `research/summaries.md` actually report, or an explicit note that the pool reports no common metric and why.
- No example statistic, sample size or effect size appears anywhere in `outline.md`; where a value was needed to show a claim's shape, a bracketed slot stands in its place.

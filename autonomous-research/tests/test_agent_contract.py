"""The pipeline's file contract, checked as data rather than trusted as prose.

Every agent file declares a **Reads:** and a **Writes:** line. Together those
lines are a dependency graph, and the graph was broken for a long time in a way
that no reader caught: stages 10 to 18 all read `full_draft.md`, and no stage
produced it. A model following the prompts had to invent the merge, and the
usual invention was to concatenate whatever was in `sections/`, stage reports
included. Stage 9.5 and the move of every report to `review/` closed both holes.

These tests parse the markdown and assert the three properties that keep it
closed. They are also run against a reconstruction of the pre-change contract,
so a check that cannot fail is itself a test failure.

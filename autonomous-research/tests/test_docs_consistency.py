"""Cross-file consistency of the prompt bundle, checked rather than read.

Every defect this file guards against was found by hand in a bundle whose
individual files each read as correct. That is the shape of the problem: a
prompt bundle has no compiler, so two files can state different numbers for the
same thing indefinitely and every reviewer who reads either one in isolation
comes away satisfied. The stage that runs second silently edits over the stage
that ran first, and neither is wrong on its own terms.

Eight defects of exactly that shape were found and fixed by hand:

  * `references/paper-types.md` listed the short-piece tier as "1-7, then 10,
    11, 15", omitting stage 9.5. Stages 10, 11 and 15 all read `full_draft.md`,
    which `scripts/assemble.py` produces at 9.5, so that tier did not describe a
    shorter pipeline, it described one that reaches stage 10 with nothing to
    read.
  * The length-target share column read 29 percent for the two largest
    sections, against a base the rows do not sum to, and the column totalled 102
    under a Total row asserting 100.
  * The sentence-length distribution summed to 103.
  * Two files pointed at `agents/01-scout.md` under "Balance temporally", which
    is a bullet inside "Quality filtering" and not a heading, breaking the
    file-and-heading convention `references/paper-types.md` states in its own
    opening.
  * `agents/15-polish.md` quoted a mean sentence length to a decimal place and
    called it the average of stage 14's band midpoints, when two of those bands
    are open-ended and have no midpoint to average.
  * `SKILL.md` forbids "any accuracy guarantee" about the output in its closing
    section, and 250 lines earlier called a hand-edited citation database a
    defeat of "the only citation guarantee this skill makes", asserting in one
    passage the promise the other bans. Both passages read as careful on their
    own; only reading them together shows one making the claim.
  * `SKILL.md`'s pipeline table listed stage 4 as writing only
    `research/citations.json`, while `agents/04-citation-manager.md` declares
    `research/citation-notes.md` as its second output and its own "Done when"
    requires that file to exist with all four headings. The table is what a
    reader follows stage by stage, so the omitted file was one nobody created.
  * `agents/06-formatter.md` sets a floor of fifty or more references for a
    literature review, while the full-paper tier row allows twenty-five to
    fifty sources. The default request, a narrative review at default scale,
    therefore met two numbers that cannot both be satisfied, with nothing
    saying which governs.

Each check below is run against a mutation that reintroduces its defect, so a
check that cannot fail fails the suite instead of passing quietly.
